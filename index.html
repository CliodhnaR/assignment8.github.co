		<ul>
			<li>I selected the meowfacts API which gives a random fact about cats.</li>
			<li>The site is <a href="https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts">https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts</a> which I found from the list of public APIs on github <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#animals"> https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#animals</a></li>
			<li>The first option for the API request was sending a request to the API, getting the data, and then displaying it. It has more steps than the second option, but you are able to see what is happening at each stage more clearly. The second option for the API request was to use fetch and parse through the data and display it. This step is more straightforward and shorter.</li>
			<li>Two applications that this API would be useful for would be a website that has information about cats or an app that gives general animal facts, in conjunction with other APIs.</li>
